 * Purpose: Personal Best
Write a program that asks for the name of a pole vaulter and the dates and vault
heights (in meters) of the athleteâ€™s three best vaults. It should then report, in order of
height (best first), the date on which each vault was made and its height.
Input Validation: Only accept values between 2.0 and 5.0 for the heights.
