/*
 *  File:  main.cpp
 * Author: Gavin Mullins
 * Created on January 18, 2017, 10:28 PM
 * Purpose: Sum of Numbers
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should use
a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example,
if the user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ 50.
Input Validation: Do not accept a negative starting number.
